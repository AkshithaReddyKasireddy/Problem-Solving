#You are given a positive integer array skill of even length n where skill[i] denotes the skill of the ith player. Divide the players into n / 2 teams of size 2 such that the total skill of each team is equal.
#The chemistry of a team is equal to the product of the skills of the players on that team.
#Return the sum of the chemistry of all the teams, or return -1 if there is no way to divide the players into teams such that the total skill of each team is equal.

class Solution:
    def dividePlayers(self, skill: List[int]) -> int:
    
        skill.sort()
        c=0
        for i in range(1,(int(len(skill)/2))+1):
            if skill[0]+skill[-1] != (skill[i-1]+skill[-i]):
                return -1
            c+=(skill[i-1]*skill[-i])
        return c
